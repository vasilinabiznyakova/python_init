The datetime module has a timedelta class that is used to represent the difference between two points in time.
Object can be created with params days, seconds, microseconds, milliseconds, minutes, hours, weeks
if param is not set it will be equal to 0
if you deduct 1 datetime object from another you will receive timedelta obj
The maximum range for timedelta is limited to approximately 9999 years
