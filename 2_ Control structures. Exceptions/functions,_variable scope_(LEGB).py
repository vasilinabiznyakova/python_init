Functions are the way of grouping code that do exact task

Function created with the help of keyword def

def say_hello():

# End of function say_hello()

# function execution
say_hello()

# unction execution
say_hello()


Function arguments
Some data that can be passed to function when its being executed

Parameters of function is those name that noted when function is declared

Typing function parameters

!!! In Python, starting with version 3.5, you can use "type hints" to indicate the expected types of parameters. This makes your code more understandable and can help you spot potential errors.

Return result is done by operator return 

Procedure and function the difference is that procedure do not return anyhting, while fucntion returns

"""Principles of object mutability in Python
Immutable types in Python are those that cannot be changed after they are created.
They are: integers int, real numbers float, strings str, and tuples
Variable types, such as lists, dicts, and sets, can be mutated. When a mutable object is passed to a function, a reference to that object is passed, and changes made inside the function are reflected in the original object.

Visibility areas (LEGB)
1) L - Local  => internal level, where the name is defined inside a function or block of code.
2) E - Enclosing => This is a scope that encloses the local scope. If a function is inside another function, the names defined in the enclosing function will be available to the inner function.Inner function can read but not change aouter data
3)G - Global => module 
To change a global variable inside a function, you must use the global keyword.
4) B - Built-in => This is the outermost level that contains the names built into Python.

Key function arguments

Key arguments in Python functions are a way of passing arguments to a function where each argument is given a name.
